  - Module: A reusable block of code whose existence does not accidentally impact other code.

  - CommonJS modules: An agreed upon standard for how code modules should be structured.

  - First-Class functions: Everything you can do with other types you can do with functions.

  - An expression: A block of code that results in a value.

  - Invoke: Run the function.

  - Name/value pair: A name which maps to a value.

  - Object: A collection of name/value pairs.

  - Object literal: Name/value pairs separated by commas and surrounded by curly braces.

  - Inheritance: One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object.

  - Function constructors: A normal function that is used to construct objects.

  - Primitive: A type of data that represents a single value. /not an object/

  - IIFE = Immediately Invoked Function Expression

  - Scope: Where in code you have access to particular variable or function.

  - require is a function, that you pass a "path" too
  - module.exports i what the require function returns

  - JSON = Javascript Object Notation: A standard for structuring data that is inspired by Javascript object literals.

  - Revealing module pattern: Exposing only the properties and methods you want via an returned object.

  - Mutate: To change something.

  - Event: Something that has happened in our app that we can respond to.

  - Event listener: The code that responds to an event.

  - Magic string: A string that has some special meaning in our code.

  - Template literal: A way to concatenate strings in javascript (ES6).

  - Syntactic sugar: A feature that only changes how you type something, but nothing changes under the hood.

  - Asynchronous: More than one process running simultaneously.

  - Synchronous: One process executing at a time.

  - Callback: A function passed to some other function, which we assume will be invoked at some point.

  - Non-blocking: Doing other things without stopping your programming from running.

  - Buffer: A temporary holding spot for data being moved from one place to another.

  - Stream: A sequence of data made available over time.

  - Binary data: Data stored in binary (sets of 1s and 0s)

  - Character set: A representation of characters as numbers.

  - Character encoding: How characters are stored in binary.

  - Byte: 8 bits.

  - Error-first callback: Callbacks take an error object as their first parameter.

  - Chunk: A piece of data being sent through a stream.

  - Abstract (base) class: A type of constructor you never work directly with, but inherit from.

  - Pipe: Connecting tow streams by writing to one stream what is being read from another.

  - Method chaining: A method returns an object so we can keep calling more methods.
